# my little SRE Sandbox #1
***Please note:** this is not a PRD-ready implementation... A just-for-giggles prototype if you will.
Read the story - it will make better sense...*
## TL;DR
While doing a log parsing *exercise*, I figured I'd expand on a more practical use-case and built a **Request Filter / Blocker** - that uses rules to block all traffic from an offending IP to a set URL after a set number of failures.
Implemented on a Controller-level and as a Middleware and using In-Memory DB via EF6.

# Use-case:
To block malformed or unsafe traffic to a monitored endpoint using rules, e.g. you have a DoS or a broken client sending bad requests and don't want them to drag you down from performance or security perspective.
Rules define: endpoints matching and blocking patterns and request methods to watch and block. 

**Logic:**
 - If a request to a specific path fails, start tracking requests from that origin (single IP)
 - Keep counting failures requests from the same origin until a threshold is reached 
 - When above threshold in a time bucket, block traffic from that origin to the path
	 - Return `429 Too Many Requests` with `X-Rate-Limit` headers
	 - When the time bucket expires, reset/clear the tracking
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
User ->> Endpoint: Request /XXX - Good 
Endpoint ->> User : Response

User ->> Endpoint: Request /XXX - Bad < threshold
Endpoint-->> Blocker: Track this origin
Endpoint ->> User : Response

User ->> Endpoint: Request - Bad > threshold
Endpoint-->> Blocker: What do we do?
Blocker-->> Endpoint: Deny XXX
Endpoint ->> User : 429 Too Many Requests
User -x Endpoint: Request - Bad > threshold
```
It can be applied at the API Controller level and would be cool but not very practical in terms of maintenance and code expansion, though can be used on a one-off basis I suppose.
A better approach would be to use it as a Middleware for the entire site. OR better yet, implement as reverse-proxy, which would scale much better in a farm. 
## What's where / contents
 - **Controllers**
 	 - `/Test`
	    - `ResponderTestController.cs` - a `test API` that allows you to get response with a controlled status; implements    FailedRequestBlocker on the Controller-level - cool but not very practical at scale, though can be used on a one-off basis I suppose
	 - `/FailedRequestBlocker`
		 - `FailedRequestRulesDBController.cs` - manage blocking rules
		 - `FailedRequestLogDBController.cs` - manage filter records
		 - `FailedRequestCleanupServiceController.cs` - manage the cleanup service
	 - `/LogParser`
		 - `apacheLogParserAsyncController.cs` - a more practical for implementation of simple log parser 
   		 - `apacheLogParserController.cs` - same but sync
  - **Middleware**
	  - `FailedRequestBlockerMiddleware.cs` - primary filter as a m/w implementation, i.e. meat and potatoes of this repo 
   	 - `FailedRequestLoggingContext.cs` - DB context for tracking records and rules
   	 - `CleanupService.cs` - stale tracking record cleanup background service
   	 - `RequestLoggingMiddleware.cs` - a test HTTP logger middleware
## 0. apacheLogParserCLI 
This is where it started... 
A simple access log parser, but was actually fun to write in Python and C#
 - parse sample log regex, aggregate in a few different ways
 - ... then find **unsafe** POST by time bucket, i.e. above threshold per bucket size

### Rules
Multiple Rules can be layered and fine tuned.
 
**Example:**
IF any `5` of `POST, PATCH, PUT or DELETE` requests to `regex:/api/responder/respond/as/.*` from the same IP fail within `3 minutes`
THEN deny access to `/api/responder/respond/as/` to `ALL` traffic from that IP for  `3 minutes`
THEN keep blocking until no requests have been blocked in the last `3 minutes` 
THEN keep checking traffic from the origin until `5 minutes` elapsed with no recurrence 
THEN after `5 minutes` forget what happened 

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Default Rule - MW",
    "threshold": 5,
    "ip": [],
    "methodsMatch": [
      "POST",
      "PATCH",
      "PUT",
      "DELETE",
      "UNKNOWN"
    ],
    "methodsBlock": [
      "ALL"
    ],
    "pathMatch": [
      "regex:/api/responder/respond/as/.*"
    ],
    "pathBlock": "/api/responder/respond/as/",
    "status": [
      400,
      401,
      402,
      403,
      404,
...
      599
    ],
    "period": "00:03:00",
    "forgetAfter": "00:05:00",
    "responseStatus": 429,
    "responseMessage": "Too Many Requests within the 1m period."
  }
]
```

# The Story 
*- feel free to skip to the meat and potatoes* 
I had an interesting experience at an interview not long ago. Btw, it was the first ever coding test that was actually in any shape or form _relevant_ to the type of job it was for.
I flopped it though... Not sure if it was the actual requirement of the job or a limitation of test platform setup - as I understood it, the test was available in Java, Ruby or Python, with an implication that at least one of the questions will be in Python. 
My go-to is **C#** and I could not get a clarification from the recruiter, so I figured if Python is a must, I'd better brush up on it a bit and try the test as embarrassing as it may be. 

**The task** was to progressively write a series of variations on **Apache Access Log** parser:
 1. Count successful POST
 2. Aggregate successful POST size by path
 3. Aggregate failed POST by file *(I think?)*
 4.   Aggregate failed POST by Time Bucket *(I think? or something similar)*

The premise is well-founded, though I would go about it via telemetry / observability rather than sifting through logs manually. OK, so I built it in Python. Had some fun with Pandas :) Then for giggles did it net core just to make a point.
Well, why stop there, right? 
From the practical standpoint, why would you want to parse individual logs? It makes more sense to have an API you can integrate in a process. And so I ported the CLI project to an API. So far so good.

In reality, you would be forwarding the logs to an aggregator (Elastic/Prometheus/DataDog/< your fave here>), then using alerting and remedial action hooks. 
Or in most cases you would be using WAF or Reverse Proxy with security features to safeguard yourself form an attack / bad traffic and alerting on the incidence of the blocking event.
So why not write a little `FailedRequestBlocker`, right? 
When more then `N` `Barbarians` are the `(application-) Gate` per `timeframe`, slam them gates shut and tell archers to start slinging arrows (throws an *`ArcherNotImplemented`* exception for now).
So I built a `Middleware` flavour for the whole App to use and added it to `ResponderTestController.cs` as a localised flavour.     
This was fun. I decided to share it in case someone may find it useful.
